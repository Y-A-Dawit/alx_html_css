# Responsive Web Page Design

This project implements a responsive web page that adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes and enhances user interactivity with hover and active states for links and buttons.

## Features

### Responsive Design
- The layout automatically switches to the mobile version when the screen width is 480px or less.

### Styling Details
- **Links:**
  - Hover/active color: `#FF6565`
- **Buttons:**
  - Hover/active state: `opacity: 0.9`
- **Content:**
  - Max width: `1000px`, centered on the page.

### Centered Content
- The page content is constrained to a maximum width of `1000px`, ensuring a clean, centered layout on larger screens.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Responsive Design with Media Queries
The responsiveness is achieved using CSS media queries. Below is an example:
```css
@media screen and (max-width: 480px) {
  /* Styles for mobile version */
  body {
    /* Example: adjust padding or font size */
  }
}
```

### 2. Link Styling
The hover and active states for links are styled as follows:
```css
a:hover, a:active {
  color: #FF6565;
}
```

### 3. Button Styling
Buttons have a reduced opacity on hover and active states:
```css
button:hover, button:active {
  opacity: 0.9;
}
```

### 4. Centered Content
To ensure the content stays centered:
```css
.container {
  max-width: 1000px;
  margin: 0 auto;
}
```
